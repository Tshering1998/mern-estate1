        Nestled amidst the rolling hills and dense forests, the Leaky Estate
        stood as a testament to a forgotten era. Its ancient stone walls,
        weathered by time and neglect, whispered tales of bygone grandeur. Once
        a vibrant hub of aristocratic life, it now lay in disrepair, its once
        manicured gardens overrun by weeds, and its majestic halls haunted by
        echoes of the past. Legends spoke of a curse that had befallen the
        estate, driving away its inhabitants and leaving it to decay in
        solitude. Yet, despite its desolate appearance, there was an undeniable
        allure to the Leaky Estate, drawing in those curious enough to explore
        its hidden secrets.
